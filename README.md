# UPDATED Status Report & Final Report

#### Your name
Ruiqi Chang, Minu Patel

#### Your section leader's name
Joanne Nichols

#### Project title
Trash-Talk, mobile application [We have changed the project from our original project to combine a project from another class with this class]

***

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We did multiple parts of our HTML, JS files and built a database, but did not finish the original project that we had planned as we discovered that we may need to spend some money on a third-party API to get an interactive map onto our site or learn to use Leaflet.js package which is a totally new concept and requires more time than we have. With the approval of combining a project of another class’s to this final project (approval received from both professors), the new project consists of a mobile application that is named ‘Trash-Talk’ which allows users to communicate just as if they were normally texting. This will showcase the user’s name, location and how many miles apart they are from one another. This is a project of another class of Ruiqis that we decided to combine as our final project.  We have almost finished this project. We have app.js, contentments files now. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

For the new project, we still need to edit how to update the distance between the two users based on current location for more accuracy.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We still have not figured out how to let the location update and calculate the distance once the user types something in the chat room.

TrashTalk is a mobile application based on React Native framework which is also another project, but we still faced many difficulties during this project. The first challenge was how to get distance between two users in one chat room. We did not have any experience on that, so we did a lot of research and asked another professor to help us, as it was a very complicated formula using Javascript. Another challenge was how to show the “is typing” message on the screen and update the distance between the two users when the user sends a new message. We understood how to add these functions but we were not clear how to call these functions. These functions should work with the cloud Firestone database, so we looked through our existing codes. We noticed that TextInput which is a foundational component and the props: OnChangeText and OnSubmitEditing will let callback function and pass the parameters, so we research this specific part knowledge and found another props: OnEndEditing to add an "is typing" indicator in the chat-room. From this experience, I (Ruiqi) realized that learning a new programming language not only depends on the teaching of the professor, but also on my own exploration. The searching experience is an effective learning progress. Also, It's important to keep trying to write code rather than just read others codes. The most valuable learning for me (Minu) was getting the distance accuracy on the app and learning a bit from the professor that helped. It definitely gave me something new to learn and improve on. I especially enjoyed testing the chat to see how fast the messages popped up on the other user’s screen, playing around with those features was definitely a fun experience on my end. The main thing we both learned and enjoyed from this project was creating the interactable platform that allows users to connect even if they are thousands of miles apart.
